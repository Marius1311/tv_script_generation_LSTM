# tv_script_generation_LSTM
This is a simple LSTM architecture that can generate TV scripts. Part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Essentially, I train a two layer (one-directional) LSTM with word embedding to predict the next word in a sequence. Such a model can then be used to produce new text on its own.
